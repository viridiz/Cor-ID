CorID Creation Algorithm

Inputs:

    Date: Number of days since January 1st, 2024.
    Facility Number: Up to 5 digits (max 99999).
    Patient Number: Up to 5 digits (max 99999).

Steps:

    Concatenate: Convert the date, facility number, and patient number to strings. Pad the facility and patient numbers to 5 digits. Concatenate the strings in this order: [Date][Facility Number][Patient Number].
    Example: Date = 4856 (18.04.2037), Facility = 343, Patient = 1429 -> "48560034301429"

    Convert to Base36: Treat the concatenated string as a decimal number and convert it to base36.
    Example: "48560034301429" -> "H7O66N1MD"
    Add the birth year and a letter indicating biological sex of the person.
    Return the CorID: The resulting string is the CorID.


Reverse Process (Decoding CorID)

Input: CorID string.

Steps:

    Take the base36 part (the Cor-ID without the last 5 characters).
    Convert to Decimal: Convert the base36 part back to a decimal number.
    Example: "H7O66N1MD" -> 48560034301429

    Extract Data:
        Last 5 digits: Birth year and sex
        Next 5 digits: Patient Number (1429)
        Next 5 digits: Facility Number (343)
        Remaining digits: Date (4856 days since Jan 1, 2024)

    Return Data: Output the date, facility number, and patient number.
